## Misc

- [The Last 10 Percent by Stefan Zeiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmEMUwfQoSc)
  - about publishing open source scala library, which is infinitely more complicated than npm.
    - scala's npmjs.org is Sonatype,
      - sbt's docs about using it: https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Using-Sonatype.html
      - which direct you to another docs at: https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html
        which says: ```
        Sonatype uses JIRA to manage requests.
        - Create your JIRA account
        - Create a New Project ticket
          This triggers creation of your repositories.
          Normally, the process takes less than 2 business days.
        ```
