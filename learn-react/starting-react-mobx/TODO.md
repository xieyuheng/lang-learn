- save `todoState` to `localStorage`

- `observable.ts` -- use `box` to solve the problem about the scope of keys.

  - [Michel Weststrate â€” MobX and the unique symbiosis of predictability and speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBYbBbjZeX4)

  - maybe there are other ways?

- practice refactoring from `useState` to reactive state class.

- prepare for a talk about MVVM.

  - TODO We need a clear understand of why React requires hand optimizations.
    - Maybe we should implement a mini React first:
      https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp
      - Which might help me to appreciate the contribution of React.
      - Also note that, with a mini MobX and a mini React,
        we have a mini MVVM framework.

  - clear dependency boundary,
    thus easy to understand,
    thus easy to change.

  - possible to test,
    we can test the interface of a feature (the view model),
    not the detailed implementation of a feature (the dom tree).

  - easy to do further refactorings.

  - easy to refactor into (little by little).

  - optimal rendering,
    no need to think about optimising it at all.

  - bast practice,
    MVVM is used by Windows, IOS, Android,
    and Vue, Angular, Svelte, Ember, Alpine, ...
    almost all other frontend web framework.

  - easy to refactor component into subcomponents,
    because they have the same context.
