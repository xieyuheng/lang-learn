# Majordomo broker

This is an example broker implementation that partially implements
[7/MDP](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:7/MDP/). Notably, the broker and
workers do not send or listen to heartbeats.

## Expected behaviour

The example will start a broker and some workers, then do some
requests. The output will be similar to this:

```
