- [FOSDEM 2009 Scala - A Scalable Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqFryHC018k)
  - In this talk the author describes the design principles of the Scala programming language,
    which has scalability as its primary design objective.

- ["Working Hard to Keep It Simple" - OSCON Java 2011](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jg1AheF4n0)
  - Why we need functional programming and actor model
  - Object oriented programming is as important as functional programming

## Misc

- [The Last 10 Percent by Stefan Zeiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmEMUwfQoSc)
  - about publishing open source scala library, which is infinitely more complicated than npm.
    (I would rather writing scripts to use libraries locally than to use this)
  - scala's npmjs.org is Sonatype,
    - sbt's docs about using it: https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Using-Sonatype.html
    - which direct you to another docs at: https://central.sonatype.org/pages/ossrh-guide.html
      which says:
      ```
      Sonatype uses JIRA to manage requests.
      - Create your JIRA account
      - Create a New Project ticket
        This triggers creation of your repositories.
        Normally, the process takes less than 2 business days.
      ```
